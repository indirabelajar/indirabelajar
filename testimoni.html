                Before Wear my Rasain Education was very lacking in lessons. 
                But after subscribing toRasain Education thank God I was more able to understand the same material taught.
                Through the Silat Concept in Rasain Education and his learning video can take me through this 2021 SBMPTN at the Jakarta State Polytechnic.Anyway after
                I Wear Rasain Education I understand more about Mathematics, economics etc.

                Previously I had a UTS value of 70. However, since studying with a private tutor from rasain 
                education I made up 90. A unique and fun experience with rasain education teachers is made in 
                small books whose contents are lattices plus the theory. So it makes it easy for me to get to study.

                Kak Dwi is a fun, patient, slang teacher, and a great teacher. Because Kak Dwi always helps 
                me during the learning process. How to teach it is also okay. Guru Barules is indeed the best

                Studying at Rasain Education is very helpful. Moreover, it is at the forefront of UTBK like this.
                How to teach is very easy to understand and the teacher is also very fun.

                Ordering private teachers in the halles is very easy. The teacher is good,fun, and the way
                he teaches and deliveries are good, so far my math grades have also improved for the better.
                I used to be my math when I was in middle school a little bad because it took
                too long a vacation as long as UN elementary school but now the math grades alone are getting better
